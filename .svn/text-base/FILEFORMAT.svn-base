    Attribute**: Comment - users settable text for the connection (string)


ENCRYPTION:
    The attributes with ** are encrypted with the DES Cipher encryption algorithm already included with VNC.  Unlike the VNC encryption, a fixed key is NOT used.  When encryption is used, a password will be used as the key to encrypt the private attribute fields.


WHY XML:
    "(C)onfiguration files donâ€™t stay simple for long. Using XML means that we can stand a chance of managing the growth in complexity of the configuration system over time." (The Wilson Project, http://www.wilson.co.uk/Software/vnc/VncMonitor.htm)


BACKGROUND:
    This file format is based on The Wilson Project's VNC Monitor.  This expands on it by adding tags and attributes, but their configuration files are still compatible and can be used by VncThumbnailMonitor.


COMPATABILITY:
    VNCon - maybe xml parsable if the tag VNCon is detected, then parse the remaing #PCDATA
    index.vnc - html file, could be parsed as XML
    RealVNC's Save Files - none yet
