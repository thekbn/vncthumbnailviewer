To Do List:

! When I try to connect to a non VNC computer, the program gives me a net error and leaves the space in blank. This is ok, but i canâ€™t remove this space.
! Host's clipboard is being transferred to the multiple computers??


- Remove use of ListIterator and AbstractList -- it's from java 1.2
- Clean up the password & username strings in the unencrypted save file (contains many escaped null characters)
- Reorganize the launchViewer code between VncThumbnailViewer and VncViewersList (and AddHostDialog)

+ Listen for "Quit" event.

+ Invoke a repaint when maximize button is clicked
+ Hide the Cursor when view only
	Additionally: Disable Cursor Shape Updates
+ Scale Remote Cursor
+ soloViewer should be like the original vncviewer
	independent frame
	no scaling
	scroll panel
	AND multiple of them
+ Return a viewer to it's origianl location in main Frame's layout when soloHostClosed


+ Gracefully handle loading a (very) large list of hosts. (Perhpas a preference for max number or overflow into tabs in the main window.)


+ Remove use of VncViewer, instead create new class called VncViewerThumbnail (VncViewerTN)
+ New GUI (more like apple's remote desktop)
